## Features

- **Linkage Mechanism Visualization** - Create and visualize complex linkage mechanisms with support for various joint types
- **Real-Time Kinematics Simulation** - Run simulations and observe mechanism behavior in real-time
- **Motion Analysis** - Analyze trajectories, velocities, and accelerations of mechanism components
- **Interactive Parameter Adjustment** - Modify mechanism parameters and see instant visual feedback
- **Animation & Playback Controls** - Play, pause, step through, and speed up/slow down simulations

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Canvas API
- Progressive Web App (PWA)

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Online Demo**: Visit [Kinematics Studio Live](https://arnoutzw.github.io/kinematics-studio-app/)
2. **Local Setup**: Clone the repository and open `index.html` in your web browser

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arnoutzw/kinematics-studio-app.git
cd kinematics-studio-app
# Open index.html in your browser
```

### Installation

This is a PWA that works entirely in your browser with no server or dependencies required. For best experience:
- Install as a PWA on your device for offline access
- Use a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Usage

1. Define your linkage mechanism geometry
2. Set initial conditions and parameters
3. Run the simulation to visualize mechanism motion
4. Adjust parameters interactively to explore different configurations
5. Use playback controls to analyze motion frame-by-frame
